This Additional Detachment is linked to either a Knight Households Primary Detachment or a Lord of War Additional Detachment (chosen by the Player), as long that Detachment contains at least one Model with the Questoris Mechanicum Faction Trait. Additionally, an Army with the Mechanicum Vassals Household Paradigm is not subject to the 0-1 per Army restriction on the Preceptor Household Rank."
